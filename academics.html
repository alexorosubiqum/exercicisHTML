        <p>
          For more than a century, Simmons University has offered pioneering
          undergraduate and graduate programs that combine theory, practice, and
          real-world experience that will challenge you to see more broadly,
          think more deeply, and prepare you for leadership in the world.

        <h2>The journey starts here</h2>
        <p>
          Located in the heart of Boston, Simmons is home to a respected women’s
          undergraduate program, as well as coeducational graduate programs in
          nursing and health sciences, liberal arts, business, communications,
          social work, public health, and library and information science.
        </p>
        <p>
          Simmons combines education for leadership in high-demand professional
          fields with the intellectual foundation of the liberal arts. The
          result is a Simmons graduate prepared not only to work, but to lead in
          professional, civic, and personal life — a vision of empowerment that
          Simmons calls preparation for life’s work.
